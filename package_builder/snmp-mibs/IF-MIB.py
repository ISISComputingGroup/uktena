This table contains one entry per interface.  It defines
            objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent
            to test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an
            interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that
            interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult
            can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not
            perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The
            object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test-
            specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific)
            information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one
            test can be in progress on each interface at any one time.
            If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the
            second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when
            a prior test is active on another interface.

            Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain
            'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the
            interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the
            ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows:

          try_again:
              get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)

                  get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
              }

              /*
               * Is not being used right now -- let's compete
               * to see who gets it.
               */
              lock_value = ifTestId

              if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse,
                       ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE)
                  /*
                   * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go
                   * try again
                   */
                  goto try_again;

              /*
               * I have the lock
               */
              set up any test parameters.

              /*
               * This starts the test
               */
              set(ifTestType = test_to_run);

              wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult

              when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult
                   agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse'

              retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId

              if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid

            A manager station first retrieves the value of the
            appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically
            repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of
            ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The manager station then tries
            to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just
            retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the
            corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating
            itself.  If the set operation succeeds then the manager has
            obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the
            ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the
            semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set operation
            indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of
            the ifTestEntry.

            Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be
            setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType.
            On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to
            'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the
            results.  In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests
            by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be
            a possibility that the first test's results might be
            overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first

            results being read.  This unlikely circumstance can be
            detected by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the
            same time as retrieving the test results, and ensuring that
            the results are for the desired request.

            If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of
            time after ownership is obtained, the agent should time-out
            the manager, and reset the value of the ifTestStatus object
            back to 'notInUse'.  It is suggested that this time-out
            period be 5 minutes.

            In general, a management station must not retransmit a
            request to invoke a test for which it does not receive a
            response; instead, it properly inspects an agent's MIB to
            determine if the invocation was successful.  Only if the
            invocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request
            retransmitted.

            Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in
            order to execute them, or may even require the agent to
            reboot after completion of the test.  In these
            circumstances, communication with the management station
            invoking the test may be lost until after completion of the
            test.  An agent is not required to support such tests.
            However, if such tests are supported, then the agent should
            make every effort to transmit a response to the request
            which invoked the test prior to losing communication.  When
            the agent is restored to normal service, the results of the
            test are properly made available in the appropriate objects.
            Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned to
            an interface must be unchanged even if the test causes a
            reboot.  An agent must reject any test for which it cannot,
            perhaps due to resource constraints, make available at least
            the minimum amount of information after that test
            completes.
